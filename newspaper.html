    Kochi:After a brief hiatus, heavy rains triggered by a cyclonic circulation
    over south Tamil Nadu intensified across Kerala, wreaking havoc and causing
    severe waterlogging in many places on Tuesday. The deluge, which pounded
    Kochi city on Monday night and Tuesday morning, left low-lying areas and key
    arterial roads near Infopark inundated, throwing life out of gear and
    creating hours-long traffic snarls throughout the day. The rain gauge at the
    Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) recorded around 103 mm
    of rain in just one hour on Tuesday morning. Despite this significant
    downpour, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has not confirmed any
    cloudburst in the state, although recording 100 mm of rain in an hour
    typically classifies as a cloudburst event. The heavy rains left Kochi city
    particularly hard hit. Low-lying areas and major roads near Infopark were
    submerged, leading to massive traffic jams and disrupting daily life.
    Vehicles struggled through flooded streets as residents navigated the chaos
    caused by the intense downpour.
